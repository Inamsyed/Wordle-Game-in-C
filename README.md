# WORDLE GAME

This is a game that reflects the popular game called Wordle . My program allows the user to determine how many words they want to play the game with . Either 5 6 7 or 8 . For each of these numbers , I have a file which contains all the english words containg those number of digits . Each time the game is played a random word is chose form one of the file and the user has 6 guessen in order to find out the word is . Each time a user enetrs a guess , the program colour codes the letter to help the user determine what alphabets are included in the mysterious word .
